ALL CLASSIC FAITHFUL RESOURCE PACKS ARE DISTRIBUTING WITH THESE GUIDELINES BELOW:


Requirements if you are distributing any assets by us:


1: Give clear credit in an appropriate place. (e.g. video descriptions, pack.mcmetas, listing descriptions)

2: Link back to our Discord server or GitHub organization here:
	https://github.com/ClassicFaithful
	https://discord.gg/KSEhCVtg4J

3: You are required to get permission if you are planning on distributing any assets of the pack in any way, shape, or form. On our Discord server above, anyone with the green "Manager" role is able to give permission. 

4: Be honest about what you are using and use common sense. Basically, don't take credit for stuff you didn't make and give proper attribution to any textures you use or modify. 

5: If you are using a specific, generally small set of textures, give credit individually, however if your project is mostly our assets you can just give credit to all of them in one entry. 

6: No monetization allowed, including link shorteners. All files with assets made by us must be entirely free and open sourced, to uphold our standards. This includes redistribution on the Bedrock Marketplace or locking behind a paywall (e.g. Patreon).

7: Don't make your projects look official when they aren't. Don't copy our branding or assets in a way that would confuse the average viewer into believing a project is official when it isn't. Simply getting approval to use textures does not count as being able to pass your projects off as official. 

8: Vattic's original license for the assets contained within the original Faithful 32x32 is different from this license, and any textures created prior to March 2016 (Minecraft Release 1.9) are exempt from this as a result. However, they do have to follow the original guidelines they were licensed under, which while being similar do have differences in requiring permission and use cases. You can find the original license here, under "Usage Guidelines", if you are interested in using textures created prior to this time period:

9: This file, unmodified, must be included in all forms of content that use any assets of us, from textures to branding.


Exceptions:


1: If you're doing anything privately and undistributed to the pack (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard basically all of the requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from us in any form.


2: If your pack could be considered an add-on, do not officially list it anywhere but rather submit it to us, to add it officially. More details on this can be found below.


Follow the requirements above if you are doing any of the following:


1: Distributing the pack in any form.

2: Using our textures as placeholders.

3: Using a few textures that you cannot properly make yourself (e.g. paintings).

4: Using our textures as a base for any of your own textures.

5: Forking the project to make your own distributed edit.

6: Video content creators can distribute a modified copy with their videos/streams. 

7: Map makers can provide modified copies to go along with it.


About contributions:


1: You can contribute to our packs on our Discord server via a voting and approval system. We value community feedback and criticism and anything you have done doesn't have to go private and unnoticed if you wish. You will receive clear credit in a credits.txt file and a special role on our Discord server if no major issues are found.

2: If you've made add-ons, mod support, or backports to any of our packs we can also choose to add those officially to our repositories on GitHub. You will still receive clear credit in the pack.mcmeta of your contribution and a special role on our Discord server.

3: By submitting a texture or other contribution to us, you give us and any other contributor the permission to use and modify your texture in any of our projects, and others if we give permission to use our assets. You will still receive clear credit in any of our main projects along with the co-author(s) who modified it, but with other packs we gave permission to use your mileage will vary.

4: This applies retroactively to all contributions as well. If you do not consent to these permissions, you have the right to contact a Manager to request the removal of your textures or other contributions. 


We reserve the right to:


1: Refuse the ability to use, distribute, or modify any assets from the pack. This action would be final, generally only in the case of unusual circumstances.

2: Take legal action if you do not comply with these guidelines.

3: Change this license at any time for any reason.
