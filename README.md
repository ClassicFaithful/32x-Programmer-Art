# How to actually get to the pack:
## Important Note: Only versions 1.18 and 1.8 are currently actively supported and actually have files in the branches, your GitHub is not broken and this is not a bug. (1.6, 1.7, and 1.9 have also been started but your mileage will vary with them as they haven't been finished)

Find the version you are looking for, and from there follow the instructions below:

## If the .zip file does not show up when put in your minecraft/resourcepacks folder:

Unzip the file using any program like Winrar, 7zip, or Archive Utility. Sometimes GitHub has a bug where the folder that is created when decompressed has a second folder within it, breaking the structure. To solve this, simply drag the second folder inside the decompressed one into your resourcepacks folder. Sorry for the inconvenience.
